<p>This week has been a great week for hearing about new tech.  On Tuesday I did a presentation at work about <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net">Hudson</a> and <a href="http://sonar.codehaus.org/">Sonar</a>.  Hudson is a CI server and Sonar is a great way to track metrics on your codebase.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I went along to the Java User Group Scotland and checked out a great talk done by <a href="http://bozdagstudio.com/selcuk/">Selcuk Bozdag</a> on <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a> development.  Flex allows you to make pretty cool Flash based applications which can talk to remote services.  It isn't tied to Java like I originally thought.  There's an awful lot of out of the box charting and video tools which seem useful.</p>

<p>On Saturday I went along to the Microsoft sponsored <a href="http://www.developerdayscotland.com/main/Default.aspx">Developer Day</a> event.  They had 4 different tracts offering mainly .NET and MS SQL Server talks.  I enjoyed listening to the Virtulisation and Ruby on .NET talks especially.  I then managed to find some Perl/Flex developers I could talk loudly about the evil that is IE6 to restore the balance.</p>

<p>While at the conference I was approached by some guys from the <a href="http://disposablememoryproject.org/cameras/camera99.html">disposable memory project</a> who were at my talk the previous week at the Glasgow Techmeetup.  They handed me a modded film based camera with instructions to hand it to someone else after a single usage and after all the exposures were used the last person would hand it back to someone else.  Hopefully I'll get to see what this led to!</p>
