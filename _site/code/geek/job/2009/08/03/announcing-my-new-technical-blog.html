<div class="post">
<p>I've been running this blog for quite a while now and I know that the readers are either people who known me personally or professionally.  I've often been tempted to post very technical posts on this site but I've resisted as I know it wouldn't fit in well.</p>

<p>To get around this, and encourage me to blog further, I've created a new site <a href="http://code.joejag.com">Joejag Tech</a> which will allow me to talk about unixy, ruby goodness without confusing my parents.</p>

<p>I'll mainly be posting short articles on how to solve specific problems.  Occasionally I might go over a code kata in detail as well.</p>
