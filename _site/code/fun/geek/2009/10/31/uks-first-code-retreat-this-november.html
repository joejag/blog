          <h2>UK's first Code Retreat this November</h2>
<p class="meta">31 Oct 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I've been running <a href="http://code.joejag.com/2009/the-coding-dojo/">Coding Dojos</a> for the Tech community in Glasgow for a while now.  A Coding Dojo is a 2 hour coding session where programmers of varied skill levels come together to work on a common task.  The task is simple in scope and difficulty.  The goal is to learn, teach and improve with fellow software developers in a non-competitive setting.</p>

<p>I was approached by <a href="http://adrianmowat.blogspot.com/">Adrian Mowatt</a> and <a href="http://robertlally.com/">Rob Lally</a> from <a href="http://agilescotland.blogspot.com/">AgileScotland</a> about the prospect of getting involved with a whole day coding event in Glasgow.  I eagerly joined these two pioneers and we are happy to announce the first <b>Coding Retreat in the UK</b>.</p>
<p>We will be getting 20 keen software developers together in a room, putting them in pairs and seeing what they can achieve in 40 minutes.  Every 40 minutes the pairs change and we start again.  </p>
<p>We have selected the <b>Ruby</b> programming language to be used by pairs on the day.</p>
<p>It&#39;s happening on <b>Saturday the 21st November 2009 at Glasgow Caledonian University</b> from <b>9am to 5pm</b>. Tickets are completely <b>free</b> and available from <a href="http://codingretreatscotland.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be providing breakfast and lunch as well as drinks throughout the day.  After 5pm we full intend to retire to a nearby watering hole.</p>
<p>We are <i>limited to 20 people</i>.  So please sign up quickly as we won&#39;t be able to increase the amount of tickets!</p></p>
