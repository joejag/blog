<p><h3>Glasgow Greenmap Overview - Joseph 20min</h3></p>
<p> * Other maps<br />
Slide Point: Open people to alternative approaches depending on situations and available skills<br />
Convey: We started with something that was already working and then adapted around the needs of members, php, no solid geo frameworks<br />
Take away: These kind of projects are done the world over, start from a working base, attempt things</p>
<p>* Our approach<br />
Slide Point: We opted to start from scratch after considering limited alternatives. All the projects tools are based on Ruby.<br />
Convey: Built upon available plugins, Built on an unfamiliar framework, build around deliverable features, If you are going to do it you get final say<br />
Take away: If the tools are there use them otherwise go with the easiest option, take on tools as they become available, mitigate all boring stuff outside of meetings, keep momentum,</p>
<p>* Work with desirable tools<br />
Slide point: People want the best in their free time make it a fun learning experience and not a chore<br />
Convey: Started on PHP moved to ruby, tried xplanner but it was too heavy, basecamp is/was cool, Easy development cycle with PHP-like easiness to adopt, VPS, capistrano/webistrano</p>
<p>* A Virtual Meeting place - Basecamp<br />
Slide Point: Keep in touch and make your progress known and felt within the team<br />
Convey: A sense of belonging to a team with pictures of everyone, seeing everyones progress.</p>
<p>* Code out in the open<br />
Slide Point: Encourage people to review and be reviewed<br />
Convey:  Google code repo with reviews/changes &amp; mail group for commits code changes, bug tracking, pair programming</p>
<p>* Environment hygiene / process<br />
Slide Point: Give people quick feedback from their changes<br />
Convey: Encourage commits, allow people to show the world their efforts</p>
<h2>Random Thoughts</h2></p>
<p><Basecamp demo></p>
<p>ours (build on lovd, uses Rails and why /.,  VM images, wiki setup guide)<br />
Tools (show as tag cloud) -&gt; Basecamp (msgs, todos, milestones, files, difference from SF), Google code/maps, Wordpress, VPS (state of rails hosting and the dead desktop), Rails, XPlanner, no CI, Capistrano/Webistrano<br />
Mapping engine -&gt; geocoding, no postcoes in ireland<br />
Events that changed everything -&gt; JQuery, iPhone, Geocoding, Streetview</p>
<p>* Work with desirable tools<br />
Slide point: People want the best in their free time make it fun and not a chore<br />
Convey: Started on PHP moved to ruby, tried xplanner but it was too heavy, basecamp is/was cool, Easy development cycle with PHP-like easiness to adopt, VPS, capistrano/webistrano</p>
<p>* A Virtual Meeting place - Basecamp</p>
<p>At the time the best lightest available was basecamp but since then redmine has become available which would provide everything we were looking for but for free.</p>
<p>Slide Point: Keep in touch and make your progress known and felt within the team<br />
Convey: A sense of belonging to a team with pictures of everyone, seeing everyones progress.</p>
<p>* Code out in the open<br />
Slide Point: Encourage people to review and be reviewed<br />
Convey:  Google code repo with reviews/changes &amp; mail group for commits code changes, bug tracking, pair programming</p>
<p>Why SVN &amp; Google Code and not Git with Github?<br />
No visual tools for people unfamiliar with version control. Github launched in 2008 we started in 2007.</p>
<p>* Environment hygiene / process<br />
Slide Point: Give people quick feedback from their changes<br />
Convey: Encourage commits, allow people to show the world their efforts</p>
<p>Mixing competencies and skill sets.<br />
Designers working with coders</p>
