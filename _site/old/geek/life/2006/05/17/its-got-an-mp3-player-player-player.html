<p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I got my new car last weekend and have since been looking for any excuse to go about driving anywhere.  This has taken me to Motherwell and Greenock so far, my pursuit of perfecting (read: trying) to park in various ways has taken me to many empty car parks.  And yes.... I have tried.  You can drive with the doors open (it just pings at you saying wtf!).</p>

<p>On the music front I hope you all have the new Red Hot Chili Peppers new double album.  It's got some good tunes on it and from first listen it seems a better follow up than Foo Fighters In Your Honor was.  For my car I managed to get my hands on an iTrip which broadcasts your iPod out on the FM radio frequency so 12Gig of music just found it's way to my car without any pesky cds.  Props to Steve Morrison for showing us how it should be done.</p>

<p>If you are a webdeveloper who cares about standards (i.e. not a twat) you will be very very very happy to know that the w3c program tidy (which we normally use via the validator.w3c.org url) has been extended and is now in <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/249/">Firefox extension</a> form.  So you don't need to send HTML to a third party server anymore.  But that's not all folks!  It also will fix your markup for you to XHTML standard as well.  I removed 35 warnings on this page to make it valid in about 2 seconds.  Now that's sexy!</p>

<p>In other news I've tried the new firefox 2 Beta.  Each tab now has a close tab option on it, but more importantly for those bloggers out there textareas now have a spell check.  There are assorted other UI fixes which aren't as exciting.  </p>

<p>Quick Firefox hint:  type your google search in the location bar and it does a "I'm feeling lucky" google search for you. (This works in all versions)</p>
