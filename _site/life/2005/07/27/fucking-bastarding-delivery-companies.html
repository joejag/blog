<p>Here's a letter I sent to Amazon after ParcelForce managed to display even more incompetence then usual.</p>

<p><em>Hi,</p>

<p>I recently ordered from you and the delivery company managed to screw up the delivery (not the first time this has happened to me).</p>

<p>I was in my flat and watched in disbelief as the ParcelForce van drove past and circled my building before leaving without dropping of a note (which makes them think your crazy when you enquire without one and the site blatantly says they tried to deliver).</p>

<p>Since delivery costs a bit already (my first class delivery has now resulted in me getting 4 buses to pick up my parcel then walk home with it from their depot in the middle of nowhere). I seriously propose you tell them to implement a 'Phone the customer instead of pissing them off policy'.</p>

<p>For another &pound;1-2 they will phone you rather when they cannot get hold of you and can arrange to leave it with a neighbour, in the garage etc. Or in my case I can tell them how an intercom works to save me &pound;5 in bus fares.</p>

<p>A lot of people complain about delivery services and I belive it's all justified. Please, please, please ask them to phone the customer, I don't mind paying, it's a lot cheaper then getting a taxi/bus to their depot.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening,<br />
Joe Wright</em></p>

<p>And here's ParcelForce's Aberdeen phone number as they don't usually give it out: 08700 844 589</p>
