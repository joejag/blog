<p>Ok I've had enough of this incessant debate every day in the press about what these imaginary gods think about issues.  Every day you hear about what a crazy Muslim Cleric says, an archbishop, or a politician about subjects as inane as dress codes.</p>

<p>Having religion play any part in our society today is intellectually embarrassing and I've had enough of hearing what their bearded, multiple armed, elephant headed fairytale gods believe.  We should be ridiculing anyone who believes in such tripe, not opening up forums on how their "laws" interoperate with society.</p>
