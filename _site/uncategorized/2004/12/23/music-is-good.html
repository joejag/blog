<p>I'm bored at home, great to have MTV2 again though!  Having watched a good healthy 12 hours of MTV2 to learn who the movers and shakers are I've come to the decision that it's easy to have good taste in music when you have a channel like MTV2, best stuff atm (apart from the obvious bands) are interpol and some of graham coxton's solo stuff (quite rocky!).</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm going to create some software that allows me to review albums in my collection per year they were released then it'll save everyone else having to ask their friends what the cool bands of the year are!</p>

<p>Pure genius, thing is getting the motivation to create the damned thing.</p>
