<div class="post">
<p>Well it's been over a year since I last blogged and a lot has happened. In May last year <a href="http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/YourCouncil/Council_Committees/Councillors/w9c2679.htm">Alison</a> was elected to serve as a councilor in Glasgow. This prompted us to move from the West End to live in Dennistoun near her ward.</p>

<p>I've always previously rented accommodation and it made sense for us to buy our first flat as we were moving out. This was just before house prices dropped by over 10%! I'm slowly getting used to living in the East End and within a month of my moving here a Dominos has opened to try and recoup some of their lost profits since I moved.</p>

<p>The huge news that I have is that in August this year Alison and I got <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/potatojunkie/sets/72157606648321511/">married</a> in the Trades Hall in Glasgow. We had an awesome day that wethoroughly enjoyed. We went to Florence for our honeymoon and drank many espressos.</p>

<p>Now I've updated my blog and gave it a shiny new skin I'm planning to update it more often again (this is the 10 millionth time this has been said on a blog).</p>

<p>It's good to be back!</p>
