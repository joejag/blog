          <h2>Bye bye Benitez</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Jun 2010</p>

<div class="post">
<p>As a Liverpool fan I have shared the ups and downs of Liverpool FC with Rafeal Benitez at the helm.  We've had massive highs like the Champions League win (I still remember my celebration pose) and the FA Cup triumph.  I've always admired the Liverpool FC style of play and their crowd atmosphere.</p>

<p>I've even been lucky enough to get down to Liverpool for a holiday and many LFC games.  It's a lot like Glasgow and I love how they've developed their dockyard post-empire.</p>

<p>Benitez, like Houllier before him, spent a lot of time developing a paranoia against the board and the media.  He won many public battles with the club.  Though without new ownership coming he lost the war.</p>

<p>Here is my favourite Benitez moment:</p>

<p>In his parting words from the club; he has says everything you need to know about the man:</p>

<p><div class="quote_box" style="text-align: center;">
I&rsquo;ll always keep in my heart the good times I&rsquo;ve had here, the strong and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from Liverpool<br />
<br/><br />
I have no words to thank you enough for all these years and I am very proud to say that I was your manager.<br />
<br/><br />
Thank you so much once more and always remember: You&rsquo;ll never walk alone.<br />
</div></p>
<p>I leave you with my favourite Liverpool moment under Benitez.  1 minute left to go and 1 goal needed to progress to eventual Champions Leagure glory:</p>
