<p><img style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;" src="http://www.joejag.com/i/posts/whisky.jpg" width="180" height="120"> Recently I've became fascinated by Whisky.  Last year I went on a micro-brewery tour at <a href="http://www.westbeer.com/">West in Glasgow</a>.  In that case it's beer, but Whisky is distilled beer so it's the same ingredients and they share part of the same process.  On my recent trip to Skye I went around the Talisker distillery and was very taken by the Whisky experience.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.malts.com/NR/rdonlyres/8716573E-6CA6-4D04-A103-5F715A655644/0/Flavour_Map_GB.pdf">Whisky flavour chart (PDF)</a> was what really appealed to the inner information geek within me.   As soon as you can identify the flavour types along with their associated areas you get a much better picture of the brands on offer.</p>

<p>This set me off on a mission to experience all the different tastes that this nation provides.  It really is a crime that my previous experience was with blended whiskies intended for cocktails!  </p>

<p>I've collated information I've found online and created a <a href="http://www.joejag.com/wp/?page_id=596">whisky tasting guide</a>.</p>
