<p><img src="/i/joejager.jpg" width="60" height="66" border="0" alt="Joe JoeJag Wright" align="left" id="Headshot" style="padding-right: 10px;" />I'm one of many Joe Wright's and I currently dwell in Glasgow, UK.  I have just finished a Masters degree in Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen for which I got a Commendation</p>
<p>Previously I have lived in Helensburgh, Scotland and Pershore, England.  Though I've lived in <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/?q=http://www.joejag.com/mylife.kml?doit">a lot more places then that</a>, I have been in Glasgow since September 2005 and I live in the East End.</p></p>
<h2>What I'm doing</h2></p>
<p>I work as a Software Engineer for a large financial institution mainly programming in Java on J2EE projects.  This website will also contain other examples of my work that I produce when I get bored/inspired.</p></p>
<h2>Anything else?</h2></p>
