<h3> your education and career path </h3></p>
<h2> BSc (2000-2004) </h2></p>
<p>  Many different types of language used: HTML/CSS/PHP/Javascript, Java, SQL, C, Haskell, VB<br />
    Taken as a given that you know HTML in the industry<br />
	Only thing missing is Ruby/Python, but now part of the course apparently<br />
  Methodology discussed, team project get to try<br />
  Enjoyed Roly Lishman's robotics course.  Team based, real time, space limited embedded programming.<br />
  ??? Anyone here have a favourite course so far ???<br />
  Started a computing gaming soceity, organized trips to large LAN parties<br />
  Founding member of the Unix user group</p>
<h2> MSc (2004-2005) </h2></p>
<p>  Did a summer project using the SemanticWeb called OntoSearch, harder/longer than uni assessment<br />
  Lack of confidence, most jobs were web based using Struts, wanted to get more expience<br />
  eCommerce masters, oil bursary<br />
  fantastic group, didn't split into sub-groups, very competitive<br />
  Having Semantic Web connection, considered staying on to do a PHD<br />
  ??? How many people are thinking about going into industry, how many academia ???<br />
  Lure of all day programming meant starting job search</p>
<h2> Job Search</h2></p>
<p>  "I thought all the worlds systems would be completed by the time I finished my degree"<br />
  Started by looking for any jobs with "Java" in the title.<br />
  ??? What's the 3 most used programming languages in the UK? ???<br />
  This hampered search<br />
  During interviews the focus wasn't on what language you know, it's about judging potential (and not a jerk)<br />
  Enjoyed doing interviews, came across, 4th interview was the one when someone said yes</p>
<h2> CML  </h2></p>
<p>  During my undergrad I worked for 2 summers at a local microbiology company<br />
  Worst place to get hungry, pies!<br />
  Worked with another developer to work on a reporting system LIMS. PHP->PDF<br />
  One thing guaranteed about software development: Change<br />
  ??? Anyone here doing any technical work during the summer ???</p>
<h2> SQA</h2></p>
<p>  ??? HANDS: Who here knows the SQA?  Who here likes the SQA ???<br />
  Exam board in scotland for school children<br />
    Annual event of mixing up exam papers and giving result late<br />
  I joined as a Junior programmer, worked with the existing team of 5 devs<br />
  Majority of work outsourced, more BAs then devs<br />
  WATERFALL: I stayed for 1 year, all 3 projects I worked on were canned.<br />
  Never touched the production system, proper bearded unix geek<br />
  Took Separation of Concerns, quite literally.  All programmers had one main area, dependency on being available  </p>
<h2> Public vs Private</h2></p>
<p>  Quite enjoyed working in the Public sector.  Pay scales are fixed and transparent and good working hours.  Based on experience<br />
  Private company differences.  Longer hours, more pay, more competitive.  More meritocracy.<br />
  Alternatively become a contractor</p>
<h2> JPMC</h2></p>
<p>  Aberdeen: oil & gas, Glasgow & Edinburgh: Finance<br />
  2006 the Agile software movement was really taking off<br />
  JPMorgan looking to create an XP team with members from the Agile Scotland movement<br />
  Huge shift in way of working: Iterative, Pair programming, TDD, automation</p>
<h3>  your company (statistics, no. of employees, portfolio of clients, products and technologies); in this item it is good to say something like "knowing Java will not secure you a job" as this is the most widespread fallacy students seem to believe...</h3></p>
<h2> Statistics attack</h2></p>
<p>  Most respected company in the world by Barron's along with Goldman Sachs<br />
  ??? Do you know who was the most respected company in the world ??? Apple/Google/Amazon/Microsoft/IBM<br />
  $2 trillion dollar in assets, control over $15 trillian assets under custody<br />
  200k employees<br />
  #1-3 in all types of banking: IB, Asset, Retail<br />
  China bond, Oracle, Apple computer public<br />
  1947 Gave the money to the UN to purchase their 17-acre property for HQ</p>
<p>  "Technical company with a domain in finance" Guy Chiarello, CIO<br />
  30k technology staff (more developers then the everyone in Amazon)<br />
  Lot's of tech: Java/.NET/C++/C/Python/Ruby/Groovy/C/COBOL<br />
  ??? What do you think is the most useful skill to have in a Finance company ??? Excel<br />
  Very different problems from Web companies.  More fast and letting other systems know when events happen.  Huge amounts of data</p>
<h2> ETC</h2></p>
<p>  ETC - employees - all tech<br />
  original Mumbai: can dev and support be away from main trading locations<br />
  Opened in 1999 with 50 employees, now over 800<br />
  Numerous awards: Software Company of the Year, Open Source Excellence, Places women want to work, Times Best graduate companies<br />
  World leader in Async Messaging<br />
  Mandatory training of 10 days a year.  Financial training in first year.</p>
<h2> Finance examples</h2></p>
<p>  Car/House loan example<br />
  ??? Who owns a car, did you get a loan ???<br />
    Company don't want to lend you money, sell to IB<br />
	IB then put together and allocate a risk rating.  Pensions cannot invest in junk.<br />
	corolation risk<br />
	Can be sold back to banks<br />
	risk is offered as an interest rate -><br />
	  interest rate is probability that you won't get your money back<br />
	  IceSave offered high interest rates, most just saw it as better guaranteed offer<br />
  Commodities Index<br />
    Like a stock index, collection of Commodities: Gold, SoyBean, Oil<br />
	Invest into that index<br />
  Also do bespoke deals.  Farmer wants to sell crop at a certain price in the future, unless weather changes	</p>
<h2> Merger challenges</h2></p>
<p>  Ususal mergers are new business types<br />
  Bear Sterns 2008 merger, what tech to keep? System by system review, a lot of rationalisation<br />
  Crazy amount of systems, had 10 people in Ireland too, my friend jumped ship from them to Lehman Bros</p>
<h3> a product/service you or your company provided to a client and that you are proud of (not just software, it could be integration effort, documentation, re-development or re-purposing)</h3></p>
<h2> Technical/Manager tract</h2></p>
<p>  Devoxx conference, Majority less then 10 years experience.<br />
  Constantly losing experienced people to become managers.<br />
  Most companies do not have a carear path for technical people.</p>
<h2> FE&A</h2></p>
<p>  I worked for the IB for 3 years, then attempted to join the E2 program, didn't get on but got recruited<br />
  FE&A brough on Linux, Grid Computing, Open Source<br />
  Now investigating cloud computing similar to Google App Engine<br />
  Sun thought they were the best and you have no choice but to use.  Problems arrise</p>
<h2> FAST</h2></p>
<p>  Huge amount of developers and projects, all need certain services regardless of methodology<br />
  Harmonize, training, offer support for Open Source<br />
  FAST AS: Apache, Tomcat, Messaging, Monitoring<br />
  FAST DS: Jira, Subversion, VMs, Wiki<br />
  FAST DD: Eclipse pre-configured, tools like svn, modelling  </p>
<h2> Developer Effiencncy</h2></p>
<p>  FAST DE: Judge the quality of source code, common tools<br />
  ??? Anyone heard of Sonar ???<br />
  Over 20 million lines of Java code.<br />
  Frequency of swear words<br />
  Find programs written in a procedual rather than object fashion<br />
  Advice on how to unit test and improve code.  Fly out for 2 days in some cases</p>
<h2> Coding Dojo</h2></p>
<p>  Coding Dojo. Deliberate practice, fictional problem, TDD, retrospectice.  Trophy for "Most thought provoking".    </p>
<h2> Code Retreat</h2></p>
<p>  Day long Coding Dojo.  Doing one in Edinburgh after conference.  Every 40min switch pair</p>
<h3> your day-to-day lives (get to the office, grab a coffee, meet team, discuss priorities, etc.)</h3></p>
<h2> Meet dev for coffee in the morning</h2></p>
<p>  Meet dev to talk over programming issues  </p>
<h2> Distributed team, handovers</h2></p>
<p>  Distributed team: Sydney, Mumbai, New York, Houston.<br />
  No out of hours support model, follow the sun<br />
  2 handovers</p>
<h2> Methodologies</h2></p>
<p>  ??? "What is the ideal amount of developers on a project" ??? One, no disagreements, or communication needed<br />
  SEMAT</p>
<h2> Scrum</h2></p>
<h3> which skills do you think are useful (and why); what do you look for in job applicants?</h3></p>
<h2> Get noticed</h2></p>
<p>  Originally thought I'd just get noticed for creating good programs.  Mainly bad programs that get noticed!<br />
  Kept ear open for side projects that people needed.<br />
  Ability to speak to management, understand their need.  </p>
<h2> Graduate scheme</h2></p>
<p>  Graduate scheme at JPMC.  Over 95% retention, 2 year program.  No set quota on intake.<br />
  Leadership, learn from mistakes, interest in the banking sector.<br />
  "I've never made a mistake"<br />
  Great to see people you hired working and doing well.</p>
<h2> Senior dev interviews</h2></p>
<p>  3 years/senior.<br />
  Smart, Get things done, not a jerk<br />
  Phone interview allows you to screen. [seeMikeCode]<br />
  Not perfect process, ideally you'd want to pair with them to see if your style matches<br />
  technical certification, saves me asking lot's of technical trivia<br />
  ??? "Anyone here want to answer my favourite technical interview question, FFF" ???<br />
  Solid data structures knowledge list/map/queue.  Know the ordered, insertion types of Map/Set<br />
  Ask a bit about design patterns<br />
  Gauge how interested they are in programming.  Do they know the difference between static/dynamic.  SOLID principals</p>
<h3>  Your use of the Web (twitter, blogs, etc.) for networking and group-building is a great thing to bring up.</h3></p>
