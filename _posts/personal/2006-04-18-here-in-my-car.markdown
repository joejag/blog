  content: You sad, sad bastard.  There you are, a young man in his early 20's, and
    you are umming and arrring between a Peugeot 1007 (with electric doors for spastics
    who haven't got the muscle to push a door open) and the Honda Jazz (The Civic's
    geeky fat smelly cousin).  Not to suggest that you should live a lie and foam
    at the mouth over the Evo VIII you'll never afford, but for pete's sake, will
    you grow a pair and skip over the old spinster-mobiles and get something a with
    a bit more tang before it's too late. please?

  content: ! 'Top speed on the car is 113MPH and it does 45 miles to the gallon, not
    to mention I have to keep my insurance level down (this one is 4, which is lower
    than the 5 for the other cars in the range).


    The Civic is out of my price range and is not in the same class as the cars I
    mentioned.  I''d be very interested if you could point out a manly small car.  The
    new 207 looks more aggressive but that''s not out yet.  It''s a small car market
    aimed at women but that''s my price range so I just have to make do.


    The doors are teh future!!!


    I bought it for the interior and insurance group, the doors are a great gimmick.
    I can open the doors in the rain before I get in!  Plus drive bys will be well
    easier with the doors fully open.'

    to say. \n\nIts a decent car and all. and u got it for a good price. can i assume
    there is also a ramp so u can get ur wheelchair into it?\n\nOne word of caution
    isnt &pound;9500 a touch expensive for your first car? speaking from experiance
    u WILL bump it into things. Run over bike riders and have the police at ur door
    for leaving the scene of the crime after u prang someone in a carpark."

    The price was fairly expensive yeah, but new cars seem to start at &pound;7000
    anyway so I thought the extra &pound;2500 was worth it as this car just
    got the best score ever for the euro NCAP safety ratings.  So if/when I do
    crash I know I''ll be well protected.


    There is no ramp!'

    You can see the Grande specs <a href="http://www.parkers.co.uk/choosing/carreviews/review.aspx?model_id=1469&amp;page=8"

    The 1007 is also way too high up for a wheelchair so you can keep your disabled
    malarky to yourself, plus I&acute;d rather buy French then anything made
    in Italy.'

  content: ! 'Just a quick note.  TopGear made the 1007 the best car in the class
    and lists the 5 most important factors when choosing a car in this range in order
    of importance as:


    1. Ease of Use (small car should be well thought out)

    2. Cost

    3. Refinement (do motorways and streets)

    4. Flexibility (space, storage)

    5. Style (make sure the car appeals to you).


    Based on all the reviews I read and this shortlist you''ll notice choosing a car
    by style is a bit short sighted :p'

<p>Well I hope everyone made good use of their Easter weekend (who'd of thought Religion would be useful for something).  I spent the entire weekend soaking up knowledge about small cars and now consider myself no longer a car noob.</p>
<p>Having past my test I have found myself irratated being driven about everywhere.  Having spent a substational amount on driving lessons, not having the end product after the test makes you feel crippled.  So armed with this financially crippling desire I headed down south to my parents in order to get advice on buying my first car.</p>
<p>Magazines offer priceless information in this arena.  I got my mits on a Topgear magazine and a What Car? magazine.  I decided that my budget will stetch to a car in the "SuperMini" range aka a Hatchback.  In this arena you have a massive choice as a third of all the cars on our streets in the UK fall into this category.  The main contenders in this division for me were the Nissan Micra, Renault Clio, Seat Ibiza and the Honda Jazz.  All score well in magazines and I went to a car supermarket to check out some models.  They are all in the 8k price range and offer a mixture of space/performance/drive/style.</p>
<p><img style="float:left; padding-right: 3px;" alt="Peugeot 1007" src="{{ site.url }}/images/2006/1007.jpg"/>When I was at the car supermarket another car caught my eye though, the Peugeot 1007 (pronounced ten-oh-seven after a certain British agent complained).  It has mad electric doors rather then hinge based ones.  The finishing inside was also of a seperate class compared to all the other cars.  Most the cars in this range go for a bland interior, the 1007 Sport however has a much more stylish finish.  Peugeot have taken a massive gamble by using electric doors so the extras you get with this car are lavish for the price range.</p>
<p>Having decided on the Peugeot 1007 I then went for a test drive at the local garage (for this alone I was rewarded for &pound;150 in holiday vouchers).  I was trying out the 1.4 Petrol Manual and had my first drive on the motorway as I drove it from the showroom to my parents house.  The first thing that struck me was the elevated driving position having been used to learning in a Ford Focus.  I then let my Dad drive it back so he could form an opinion on it as well.</p>
<p>Having decided that this was the car for me we then entered the strange voodoo that is negotiating a discount on a car.  The list price for a 1.4 Sport is &pound;11,500, after saying we were leaving to go test drive the Honda Jazz then suddenly became very willing to reduce their asking price.  In the end we managed to get it for &pound;9,500 (way better then the target price listed in What Car?).  All that was left was financing for which I decided on going PCP so I pay &pound;149 a month over 3 years with a baloon payment at the end around &pound;4000.</p>
<p>With the deposit down I selected a metallic blue version to be delivered and right now I'm waiting for a phone call from the dealer saying when I can pick it up.</p>
<p>I'm now looking into insurance and Admiral seem the best to go with at the moment.  Having a girlfriend gets you a &pound;250 discount too, so if you want a car and you've just passed go get yourself a girlfriend as it pays dividends.</p>
