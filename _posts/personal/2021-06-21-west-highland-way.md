Between finishing and starting a new job, I decided to challenge myself. The challenge was to walk from near Glasgow to Fort William along a track called the West Highland Way.

It took six days and 96 miles (154km) to get there, but it was worth every second.

I was joined by Adrian and Ania for one part, but the rest was walking on my own, chatting to all the other people who are doing the walk. Each town along the way is welcoming to the walkers, and I highly recommend staying at B&Bs along the route.

My highlights:

- Walking over Conic Hill for the first view of Loch Lomond
- Entering Rannoch Moor and seeing the stunning Buachaille Etive Mor
- The friends I made along the way

I made a video each day; the aim was to amuse my kids and record my highlights.

You can see the whole video playlist on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAD8NFT5xIU&list=PLKRdpZgP5nAm-IdErRqXdBP7T2dl6lXFc). Each day is about seven minutes of video.
