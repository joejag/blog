Nearly a year ago, I let you all know that I am suffering from [liver disease](/2019/liver-disease) and doing what I can to reverse it.

I've been trying out different habits, exercises, and eating patterns and posting on how I'm progressing every six weeks.

### Goal update

Weight at start: 105kg / 47.5% fat
<br/>18 weeks ago: 80kg / 26.4% fat
<br/>Current weight: **83kg / 26.1% fat**
<br/>Goal weight: 74kg [(according to BMI)](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/) or 20% [body fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fat_percentage#Typical_body_fat_amounts).

### Thoughts on the last 18 weeks

I've totally lost my discipline.

Christmas wasn't too bad, but the second lockdown has hijacked my good habits around walking kids to school and going out for long walks at weekends. Those weekend walks meant I didn't overindugle the night before as I wanted to be in good shape. Now, what's the point? I've walked the same park over 100 times in the last 18 weeks. It's really dull now.

I've been trying to recover habits so I didn't have to post my first ever "Whoops - I gained weight" update, but this is where we are.

### Next six weeks

Being able to travel for outdoor informal exercise would be great. But I cannot rely on that changing soon. I've been looking at some longer walks you can do around Glasgow city centre, there's one where you go past 21 bridges and another taking in all the Murals around the city.

Deep down I know what to do. It's written above in the table. Log what you eat, exercise twice a day. I'll try to get back to who I was before.
