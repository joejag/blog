<p>Just a quick note to say that the <a href="http://www.techmeetup.co.uk">Techmeetup group</a>, which is well established in Edinburgh already, are meeting in Glasgow tonight and I think Kevin and I will be doing out Greenmap talk.  I think this could be the first meeting in Glasgow too.  About 70 folk turn up for the Edinburgh one so it should be good.</p>
<p>7pm in Room M329, James Weir Building, 75 Montrose Street, Glasgow.</p>
