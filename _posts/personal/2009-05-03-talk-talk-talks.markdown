  content: ! 'Sweet, wish I could have came. I''ll bet there are those who will read
    your blog with a note of surprise when you have nice things to say about flash.
    But I think flash is great as a media streaming and animation tool flex is just
    making it more realisable.


    UI note: below every post you have on your blog you could have a ''post a comment''
    link or something similar as I had to scroll back up the page to hit on the comment
    number in the balloon!'

  content: ! 'I''m pretty surprised I have nice things to say about Flash as well!  A
    lot of Flash is used for adverts or trivial things, but seeing the Google Analytics
    functionality showed it can be used for the forces of Good also :)


    It seems all the RIA stuff is done in a non HTML/Javscript way such as Flex,
    Silverlight and JavaFx.  I guess I have to choose a horse.


    UI Note: The bit saying 0 Comment(s) is a link to add a comment too.  I''ll make
    it say "Be the first to comment"'

<p>This week has been a great week for hearing about new tech.  On Tuesday I did a presentation at work about <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net">Hudson</a> and <a href="http://sonar.codehaus.org/">Sonar</a>.  Hudson is a CI server and Sonar is a great way to track metrics on your codebase.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I went along to the Java User Group Scotland and checked out a great talk done by <a href="http://bozdagstudio.com/selcuk/">Selcuk Bozdag</a> on <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Flex</a> development.  Flex allows you to make pretty cool Flash based applications which can talk to remote services.  It isn't tied to Java like I originally thought.  There's an awful lot of out of the box charting and video tools which seem useful.</p>
<p>On Saturday I went along to the Microsoft sponsored <a href="http://www.developerdayscotland.com/main/Default.aspx">Developer Day</a> event.  They had 4 different tracts offering mainly .NET and MS SQL Server talks.  I enjoyed listening to the Virtulisation and Ruby on .NET talks especially.  I then managed to find some Perl/Flex developers I could talk loudly about the evil that is IE6 to restore the balance.</p>
<p>While at the conference I was approached by some guys from the <a href="http://disposablememoryproject.org/cameras/camera99.html">disposable memory project</a> who were at my talk the previous week at the Glasgow Techmeetup.  They handed me a modded film based camera with instructions to hand it to someone else after a single usage and after all the exposures were used the last person would hand it back to someone else.  Hopefully I'll get to see what this led to!</p>
