title: October 2019 Health Report
---

Welcome to the first edition of a six-weekly report into how well I'm doing with reversing [liver disease](/2019/liver-disease) and life in general.

### Goal

Weight at start: 105kg
<br/>Current weight: 100kg
<br/>Goal weight: 74kg [(according to BMI)](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/)

### Habits report

I started five habits that I'm trying to keep up:

| Name                                                   | Kept to it?      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Aim to lose 5kg every six weeks                        | Yes, 5kg lost    |
| Go for a run at least two times a week                 | 6 weeks out of 6 |
| Use calorie counting to keep my eating habits in check | 2 weeks out of 6 |
| Stop using lifts                                       | 6 weeks out of 6 |
| Have at most one night a week with alcohol consumption | 5 weeks out of 6 |

I purchased a [FitBit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07G18N2YY/ref=pe_3187911_185740111_TE_item) which has motivated me to walk more and take more care of my sleeping pattern.

### Next six weeks

I'm going to stick with the same habits. I've bought an [Oculus Rift](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PTMKYS7/ref=pe_3187911_185740111_TE_item) which has some high energy games. I'm going to try including them to burn some extra calories.

Calorie counting I find easy to stop doing, but I notice each time I do I start having little cheat snacks. I'll try and stick with it better for the next few weeks.

### Good things in this period

### Bad things in this period

- I got a cold which took me off work for a week. I decided to eat my way out of the cold, which left me a kilo up by the end of the week. Reduced calorie intake and being ill isn't something I can do.
- I tried to start using a toilet three floors above where I work to get extra exercise which started well. After a week, I was getting knee pains from going up and down the stairs multiple times a day.

See you again around the 11th November.
