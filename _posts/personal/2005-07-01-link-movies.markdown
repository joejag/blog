<p>So in between playing World of Warcraft all the time I go to pub quizes on a Thursday night.  During which there is a movie linking round where you have to link 2 movies together by an actor that is in both.</p>
<p>After thinking about this for a while I decided to make a program so I could cheat on my phone.  4 hours later I can unveil to you.... <a href="/bacon">my Kevin Baconizer!</a></p>
<p>Put in 2 movie titles in and it will tell you the common actors in the movies.  Simple and effective.</p>
