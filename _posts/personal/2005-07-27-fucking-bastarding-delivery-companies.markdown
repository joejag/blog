    content: ! 'yes, ive been burned by aberdeen parcelforce too, i waited in all Wed
      and Thurdsday, expecting a parcel that left a shop Tuesday by parcelforce24, when
      i tried to track things Friday, i am told they tried to call 5:30 Thursday, i
      know this isnt true because i didnt go out and i remember changing the TV at 5:35
      to catch neighbours! how bored was i by then!?!?!!

    content: ! "Ah the truth at last! Peter Griffin would really grind his gears at
      those delivery schmucks. Its the inter city (yellow and green van) gits that really
      get my goat. If they fail to deliver, and believe me reading the calorie content
      from the side of a Ginsters pasty is stretching it for them, then you have to
      go all the way to Altens.  Usually to be told the twats still out as he's got
      lost another 50 times that day.\n Fight the man! Lets get educated folks driving
      these vans! Hmmm well acutally Aberdeen does have a disproportionately large number
      of geography graduates..."

<p>Here's a letter I sent to Amazon after ParcelForce managed to display even more incompetence then usual.</p>
<p><em>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently ordered from you and the delivery company managed to screw up the delivery (not the first time this has happened to me).</p>
<p>I was in my flat and watched in disbelief as the ParcelForce van drove past and circled my building before leaving without dropping of a note (which makes them think your crazy when you enquire without one and the site blatantly says they tried to deliver).</p>
<p>Since delivery costs a bit already (my first class delivery has now resulted in me getting 4 buses to pick up my parcel then walk home with it from their depot in the middle of nowhere). I seriously propose you tell them to implement a 'Phone the customer instead of pissing them off policy'.</p>
<p>For another &pound;1-2 they will phone you rather when they cannot get hold of you and can arrange to leave it with a neighbour, in the garage etc. Or in my case I can tell them how an intercom works to save me &pound;5 in bus fares.</p>
<p>A lot of people complain about delivery services and I belive it's all justified. Please, please, please ask them to phone the customer, I don't mind paying, it's a lot cheaper then getting a taxi/bus to their depot.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,<br />
Joe Wright</em></p>
<p>And here's ParcelForce's Aberdeen phone number as they don't usually give it out: 08700 844 589</p>
