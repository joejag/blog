<p>Around this time of year it's great to have a festive tipple such as Bucks Fizz, Mulled Wine or Mulled Cider.  I've started making my own Mulled Cider recently as it's made from fairly common spices.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<p><img width="480" height="360" src="{{ site.url }}/images/2011/1-ingredients.jpg"/></p>
<ul>
<li>4 cans of cider (Scrumpy recommended)</li>
<li><b>Spices</b>: 6 cloves, 3 star anise, &frac14; nutmeg (finely grated), 1 cinnamon stick, 1 vanilla pod (halved, or &frac12; teaspoon of vanilla extract)</li>
<li><b>Juices</b>: 1 orange, 2 clementines, 1 pomegranate (with seeds)</li>
<li>To taste: 4 or 5 tablespoons of caster sugar</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h3>Method</h3></p>
<p>Add the cider to a large pan.  Heat it on low heat for 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Add the spices and the juice of each fruit.</p>

<p>Then crank up the heat to boiling.  Once boiling turn the heat down and simmer for 6 minutes.</p>

<p>Grab a spoon and take a taste of your wonderful concoction.  It probably needs sugar.  Add two tablespoons of sugar at a time until you get a good balance of sweet and spicy.</p>

<p>Once the sugar is mixed you can enjoy your creation immediately.  Grab a ladle and put it into a mug or glass.</p>
