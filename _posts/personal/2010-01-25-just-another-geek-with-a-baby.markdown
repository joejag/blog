  content: ! 'Hey, congratulations. Hope the fact you have an EAP scan isn''t a sign
    of problems (or that any problems are resolved).


    Our first is due on July 11th - World Cup Final day! My wife says she''s planning
    on going into labour at the end of Extra Time when it''s Germany 2 - 2 England,
    and penalties are looming.


    Me - I''m hoping for it to be a week early, just as Murray goes into a 5th set
    against Federer. That''ll teach her!


    (p.s. You might want to obfuscate some of the data in the picture, e.g. your wife''s
    name and the dates)'

    I can''t remember where the pictures came from now!


    But yes, very practical advice for new parents like us.'

<p>Last year after watching children run around laughing, Alison and I decided it's time to have our own kids.  A few months later we were checked in to get our first baby scan.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2010/nine_weeks.jpg" width="490" height="370" /></p>
<p>At this point the baby is the the same size as an <a href="http://www.in-gender.com/cs/forums/t/94345.aspx">Apple pip</a> or a <a href="http://www.hisboyscanswim.com/605/tarzans-ultimate-guide-to-baby-sizes-week-by-week-for-soon-to-be-fathers">Marble</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward 6 weeks and we are talking Baseballs and Avocados:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/2010/fifteen_weeks.jpg" width="490" height="370" /></p>
<p>The baby (we don't want to know the sex) is due on the 26th June.  Right during the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/kostage.html">knockout stages</a> of the World Cup.  Alison says she's going to wait for an England game to give birth!</p>
