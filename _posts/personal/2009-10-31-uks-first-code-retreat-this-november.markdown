  content: ! 'Hey Joe, really wanted to get to this - I love the idea, but I couldn''t
    make it that weekend.  You mentioned another event in March, do you have a date
    I can put in my diary?


    Cheers,

    Neil.'

    It was great fun.  We''ll be doing one in Manchester in February and one in Edinburgh
    in March next year.  No plans at present to do another Glasgow one, but we''ll

  content: This sounds great. How simple is simple though? I have some coding experience
    mostly in VB and I have a basic grasp of the general principles. Do you think
    the February workshop would be somewhere I could learn stuff and maybe give my
    two penneth when it comes to non-language-specific thinking? Or does it require
    Ruby experience?

<p>I've been running <a href="http://code.joejag.com/2009/the-coding-dojo/">Coding Dojos</a> for the Tech community in Glasgow for a while now.  A Coding Dojo is a 2 hour coding session where programmers of varied skill levels come together to work on a common task.  The task is simple in scope and difficulty.  The goal is to learn, teach and improve with fellow software developers in a non-competitive setting.</p>

<p>I was approached by <a href="http://adrianmowat.blogspot.com/">Adrian Mowatt</a> and <a href="http://robertlally.com/">Rob Lally</a> from <a href="http://agilescotland.blogspot.com/">AgileScotland</a> about the prospect of getting involved with a whole day coding event in Glasgow.  I eagerly joined these two pioneers and we are happy to announce the first <b>Coding Retreat in the UK</b>.</p>
<p>We will be getting 20 keen software developers together in a room, putting them in pairs and seeing what they can achieve in 40 minutes.  Every 40 minutes the pairs change and we start again.  </p>
<p>We have selected the <b>Ruby</b> programming language to be used by pairs on the day.</p>
<p>It's happening on <b>Saturday the 21st November 2009 at Glasgow Caledonian University</b> from <b>9am to 5pm</b>. Tickets are completely <b>free</b> and available from <a href="http://codingretreatscotland.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be providing breakfast and lunch as well as drinks throughout the day.  After 5pm we full intend to retire to a nearby watering hole.</p>
<p>We are <i>limited to 20 people</i>.  So please sign up quickly as we won't be able to increase the amount of tickets!</p>
