title: I'm helping at Clojure Bridge Edinburgh
---

Following on from the rampant success of the [RailsGirls](http://railsgirls.com/) events, an organisation has been created to do the same for Clojure called [ClojureBridge](http://www.clojurebridge.org/)

<blockquote>
ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for women.
</blockquote>

I'm helping out at their event on [Saturday in Edinburgh](http://www.clojurebridge.org/events/2014-09-26-edinburgh). It's free to sign up and food will be provided. No previous programming experience is required, just bring along a laptop and we'll learn the rest together.

[Ali King](https://twitter.com/ali_king) with [Girl Geeks Scotland](http://www.girlgeekscotland.com/) will be making sure the event runs smoothly. In particular I'll be teaching how functions and flow control work in Clojure. My friend [Adrian Mowat](https://twitter.com/mowat27) will be covering data structures.

I'd appreciate if you'd share this post, or the event page, with anyone you think may be interested in this event.
