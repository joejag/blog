  content: ! "Hi,\nI am writing a Geek Guide to Glasgow and intend to include your
    blog in the Social section, based on the fact that you have recently organised
    a Startup. Is that OK with you? \n\nI would be glad of any suggestions you might
    have for places, contacts etc that the visiting or newly-resident Geek might like.\n\nthanks\nnina"

<p>For the first time the runaway success that has been the <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> movement is coming to <a href="http://glasgow.startupweekend.org/">Glasgow on 25-27th May</a>.  </p>
<p>From the official site:</p>
<div class="quote_box">
<p>Startup Weekends are 54-hour events where developers, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups!</p></quote></p>
<p>Startup Weekends are weekend-long, hands-on experiences where entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs can find out if startup ideas are viable.  On average, half of Startup Weekend&rsquo;s attendees have technical backgrounds, the other half have business backgrounds.</p></p>
<p>Beginning with open mic pitches on Friday, attendees bring their best ideas and inspire others to join their team. Over Saturday and Sunday teams focus on customer development, validating their ideas, practicing LEAN Startup Methodologies and building a minimal viable product. On Sunday evening teams demo their prototypes and receive valuable feedback from a panel of experts.</p></p>
<p></div></p>
<p>I would encourage any developer, web designer, student, ideas person or artist to go along and get a feel for what it takes to get a simple pitch built up into a minimum viable product with a team over a high intensity weekend.  I'll be attending as a coach at the event.  I've enjoyed plenty of these events before as an attendee and organiser so I'm looking forward to trying out the coaching role.</p>
<p>See more details for the Glasgow event <a href="http://glasgow.startupweekend.org/">here</a>, which is being organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/_MDHayes">Michael Hayes</a> of <a href="http://rookieoven.com">Rookie Oven</a> fame</p>
