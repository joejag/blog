<p>Has already been made.  I've just watched a great movie called <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/">Sin City</a>.  Set in a fictional city full of villains, it has a very stylish look and some great casting.  It's worth it alone just for the cinematography.</p>
<p>It comes out in Europe in June but is out in the States already.  It's amazing, one of the few films that make your life feel more meaningful after watching!</p>
