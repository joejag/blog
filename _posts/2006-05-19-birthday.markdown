<p>Well I'm 24 tomorrow and will be spending the day celebrating at a Eurovision song contest party (is this a step up from a BigBrother party?).  Anyway, much free booze I hope and some comedy at a flatwarming.  </p>
<p>This is what happens when you move back to a place where only your school friends are around.  Oh and did I mention 3/4 of my best mates at school now love the cock?  That should explain the Eurovision song contest part anyway.  It's always weird being in a crowd where you become the minority when the rest of society tends to be the opposite.</p>
<p>Tonight should be good as it's a guy at SQAs leaving night so off to the local weatherspoons.</p>
