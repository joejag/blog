<p>I got a letter from Virgin Media (who bought out NTL) telling me my broadband is going up from &pound;35 to &pound;37 a month.  I managed to quickly develop the WTF look on my face at this point.  Then I read the next line....</p>
<p>As of May this year VirginMedia customers are getting <a href="http://allyours.virginmedia.com/html/existingcustomers/q2/speed.html">20MBb down and 768kbps up</a>.</p>
<p>If ADSL2 doesn't get rolled out by the end of this year I'd  expect all the cool kids to flock to cable (who can get it).</p>
