- Where: [Meikle Bin, Carron Valley](https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/glasgow/meikle-bin.shtml)
- Region: Campsies, Glasgow
- With: Alexander
- Ascent: 363m
- Distance: 10.4km
- Time: 3hr

### Climbed

- Meikle Bin - 570m

### Notes

- Alexander is now in charge of the Jelly Babies
- This route is great for people starting with hillwalking; it's a walk along a tarmac path then a steep ascent
- There's a drive-through Tim Horton's in Stenhousemuir you can go to after this route

### To improve

- Buy a bigger bag. My 11-litre bag cannot store enough stuff.
- Buy some dried mango; it seems healthier than eating Jelly Babies all-day
