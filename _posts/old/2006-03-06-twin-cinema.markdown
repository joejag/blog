    to swallow it so that I can choke on it. You know JUST to prevent hearing anymore
    of it.

<p>Well I was tidying up my joejag files today and uncovered some images from circa 2003/2004.  So I hastily made a script that thumbnailed them and put it up <a href="/jagpics">here</a>.   On a coding note, I think this simplistic approach beats the crap out of all those gallery applications you can get.</p>
<p>And in other news.... I hope you've all heard the <a href="/archive/Just.mp3">Mark Ronson remix of Radiohead's Just</a>?</p>
<p>Ah memories and great tunes redone.</p>
