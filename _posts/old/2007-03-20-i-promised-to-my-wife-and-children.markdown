  content: Yeah, I've been listening to them for a month or so.  I wouldn't compare
    them to Razorlight though.  More of a White Stripes crossed with a real Arcade
    Fire-styled bleakness in my mind.  I'm off to see them next month in Pompey, which
    should be good if their live act is as tight as the recorded stuff.  As for other
    new music, both Paul and I will vouch for the new Kings of Leon album, which is
    rather tasty cake, all be told.

  content: ! 'Yeah, I''ve heard those 2 bands mentioned in reviews in comparison.  I
    was trying to say that we should be creating more guys like that then pointless
    soft-rock.


    If you like them you should really check out the French Kicks albums called One
    Time Bells and Young Lawyer.  It''s exactly the same but from 3 years ago.'

This year we've had a good showing from Bloc Party, Arcade Fire and now I'd like to introduce Cold War Kids.  Imagine if Razorlight didn't suck.  This is how they would sound:</p>
