  content: ! 'Dude, it''s Art Brut lyrics Formed a Band messed about and put in a
    different context.


    I was being obscure thinking you''d be the one guy that would get the reference
    (and probably the only person reading the blog anyway).


    But let''s hear it for amusing each other anyway.


    I''m tagging the kids'

  content: ! 'Hey, I''m famous with the kids now!


    I liked the cartoon video to Formed a Band which was on the Bobbin jukebox.  Then
    I heard the full length was out from reading a review on <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com"
    rel="nofollow">pitchfork</a>.


    The fact that Paul only listens to music on his phone makes him cool in a Mac
    iPod loving way eh?'

<p>And yes, this is my work, it's not irony, it's not Rock & Roll, we're just <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4741630.stm">tagging</a>, the little Kids.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>This might warrant further explanation...</p>
<p>I work for the SQA who give kids unique numbers when they turn 14 so they can have their own certificates.  The Scottish Executive decided to give them the numbers when they start school instead.  This is because when some kids went missing before they just had their name to go on so they got pupils mixed up.</p>
<p>Over the last 3 months I've been working on this system with the Scottish Executive to create the numbers based on pupils numbers from schools in Scotland.  It's hilarious listening to privacy loons start saying we're using this to track what children eat etc.  They get this number when they are 14 anyway, just happens when they start school now.</p>
<p>Funny thing is that the 5 of us that worked on this are now famous!</p>
