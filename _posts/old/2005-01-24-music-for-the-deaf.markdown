    And will also think about removing the frameset but in the mean time I''ve added
    the _target for the comments homepages, though I like my URLs nice and short at
    the top as it sort of frames the URL.  I also can''t use "index.php" as I host
    more then 1 site on this and the index.php is used for mad redirection based on
    what I reckon you want to see.


    And a special damn you to Steve who implemented the music library idea I was quite
    happy to mull over without doing anything about!'

<p>Greetings to any other Joe Wright's!</p>
<p>In other news I've had a think about the best bands ever and so far I have the following.</p>
<p><em>Everclear, Soulwax, The Beatles, Nirvana, Weezer, Oasis</em></p>
<p>Not generally based on having a massively succesful back catalogue, can be just based on one or two albums.  Finding a band with a 100% track record is near impossible, (hence excusing Oasis's later efforts).</p>
