  content: Wow, the AlPacinos are still going.  I haven't heard anything about them
    for ages.  Mind you, I only knew of them because my cousin was going out with
    Colin, the drummer...

<p>Well it certainly looks like I got caught with my hand in the cookie jar.  In my last post I went after the easy target that is support bands.  Not too long after scathing a band (basically because they played a different style to the main act) the lead singer of the band posted a comment (I had said the lead singer was old, I'm 24):</p>
<p><i>"Hey Joe</p>
<p>Just came across the site, I'd just like to say I'm only 27 but that may be old in your book. Cheers for the honest feedback on the gig - guess we need to stop more between tunes and pause for breath, cos we don't have any 8 minute songs. Glad you enjoyed the other 2 bands a bit more than you did us, guess we're just not you're cup of tea.</p>
<p>Cheers + Beers<br />
Eddy<br />
THE ALPACINOS "</i></p>
<p>There was me thinking only some of my close knit friends read the site to listen to my musings.  <a href="http://www.thealpacinos.com/eddy.htm">Eddy</a> seems to have taken a positive out of my review, so I thought I'd add a slightly more accurate review.</p>
<p>The AlPacino's are a hardcore punk group from <a href="http://www.knowhere.co.uk/3180_goingout.html">Motherwell</a>, this makes them interesting on the nights billing as Presidents are a 2 guitar rock group.  To be honest, they aren't my cup of tea.  But they did have stage presence, a noticeably good drummer and even did grassroots promotion to join their mailing list.  The performance was pretty energentic and their standout track <a href="/m/The_Alpacinos-I_Am_Spartacus.mp3">I Am Spartacus</a> which they played near the end of their set is definitely a grower.</p>
<p>Incidentally you can join their mailing list and download some of their songs at <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/thealpacinos">PureVolume</a> or at their main website <a href="http://www.thealpacinos.com">The AlPacinos Online</a>.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to anyone who tries to prey on support bands... they know where you blog!</p>
