<p>On a note to other website developers I have started responding on another "Joe Wright's" blog and since we have both done this our google rank has shot up to being listed in the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=joe+wright">top 10 results</a>.  Maybe it's to do with the name and the cross-linking, but essentially it has propelled us up google in what I can only call a hack, probably the best google hack I've discovered in a long while!</p>
<p>Oh, and on the images front I found this on <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=joe%20wright">google images</a>:</p>
