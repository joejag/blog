  content: ! 'I was playing around with it for ages to see if I could make them all
    negative.  If you go very pro-war then it makes you a Tory, if you don''t then
    it relegates them quite quickly.


    AFAIK Alison is pretty neutral on the Iraq issue so it would ignore the torries
    and probably make her Lib Dem.  Everyone I know so far has been made Lib Dem from
    that.


    Though if you use the political compass online too it gives you a more accurate
    view but again skews you to the left.  Lib Dems are massively Left though and
    I''m sort of centre left.  Labour are centre right.'

  content: Nice and shiny, WordPress is the way ahead.  You could make your own (we
    all do) but this has a lovely back end you can't ever be bothered to recreate!

  content: AS there is no SNP option on the list, I feel I cannot be fully represented
    on the test. The Test also does not comment that the Lib Dems are a bunch of whores
    who will say anything to be elected (although the banning smoking/legalising
    cannabis contradiction is there for all to see...)

<p>Hello viewers,</p>
<p>Election fever has caught the beeb so I thought I'd join in and see who I'm <a href="http://www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com">supposed to vote for</a> based on the main questions posed in the manifestos this year.  Interestingly there are no other mad fringe independence parties except UKIP.  </p>
<p>Personally I thought my political views were more inline with Tony Blair, mainly out of my belief that you should vote for the 2 main parties unless the opposition were that terrible.</p></p>
<p>Much to my surprise I should vote for:</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td align="right" style="border-right:2px solid black;" height="20" valign="middle"></td></p>
<td width="50%" align="left" height="20" valign="middle">
<img src="http://www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com/tiny_grey_dark.gif" width="28" height="20">&nbsp;Labour</td><br />
</tr></p>
<tr>
<td align="right" style="border-right:2px solid black;" height="20" valign="middle">Conservative&nbsp;<img src="http://www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com/tiny_grey_light.gif" width="30" height="20"></td>
<td width="50%" align="left" height="20" valign="middle"></td><br />
</tr></p>
<tr>
<td align="right" style="border-right:2px solid black;" height="20" valign="middle"></td>
<td width="50%" align="left" height="20" valign="middle"><img src="http://www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com/tiny_grey_dark.gif" width="42" height="20">&nbsp;Lib Dems</td><br />
</tr></p>
<tr>
<td align="right" style="border-right:2px solid black;" height="20" valign="middle">UKIP&nbsp;<img src="http://www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com/tiny_grey_light.gif" width="64" height="20"></td>
<td width="50%" align="left" height="20" valign="middle"></td><br />
</tr></p>
<tr>
<td align="right" style="border-right:2px solid black;" height="20" valign="middle">Green&nbsp;<img src="http://www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com/tiny_grey_light.gif" width="38" height="20"></td>
<td width="50%" align="left" height="20" valign="middle"></td><br />
</tr></p>
<p></table></p>
<p><br /><br /><b>You should vote: Liberal Democrat</b>
<p>"The <a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk" target=_blank>LibDems</a> take a strong stand against tax cuts and a strong one in favour of public services: they would make long-term residential care for the elderly free across the UK, and scrap university tuition fees. They are in favour of a ban on smoking in public places, but would relax laws on cannabis. They propose to change vehicle taxation to be based on usage rather than ownership."<br /><br />
