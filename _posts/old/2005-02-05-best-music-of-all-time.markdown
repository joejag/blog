<p>That's right bitches.  You have 11 tracks, now nominate the best 11 tracks of all your time.  Not what other people perceive to be the best stuff ever.  Just the soundtrack of your life.  Nothing hard, apart from the decision part, I know you can do it, now add comments.... Oh and no using the same band twice!</p>
<p>Work in Progress:<br />
Soulwax - Too Many DJ's (single)<br />
Everclear - Amphetamine<br />
Soundgarden - The Day I tried to live<br />
Beatles - Yesterday<br />
Nirvana - In Bloom<br />
Oasis - Champagne Supernova<br />
Queens of The Stone Age - Lost Art of Keeping A Secret<br />
Foo Fighters - Everlong<br />
Red Hot Chilli Peppers - Under The Bridge<br />
Pixies - Where Is My Mind<br />
Weezer - Only In Dreams</p>
