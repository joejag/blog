<p>Well, it appears I was the last person to find PostSecret so here's a new link for your amusement...</p>
<p><a href="http://darthside.blogspot.com/">The Darth Side: Memoirs of a Monster</a></p>
<p>That's Darth Vader's own blog (allegedly not a marketing ploy, and it is very amusing).  The comments on the site are funny too.</p>
<p><i>"Apr 25 -- James Earl Jones is still doing insulting impressions of me at cocktail parties for cheap laughs; the prostitutes he flirts with think it's "cute"."</i></p>
