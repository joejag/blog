  content: ! 'At the time of writing I have no idea if I will be in saudi arabia for
    the whole of the world cup. (potentially missing games because those cats pray
    for 2 hours in the middle of the fucking day, meaning that I reckon the games
    are shown IN BUSINESS HOURS and I will be expected to work).


    So.. I dont want to commit. There is precious little to do in that backward fucking
    country, and apparently the Internet is just not worth it.


    Sing it with me.. "the Internet is for porn..", stuff is filtered.. Stuff is read.
    major.. fucking.. pain.. in.. the.. ass.'

<p>Ok folks it's a world cup year and you know what that means...... <a href="http://fantasyfootball.metro.co.uk">Fantasy Football!</a></p>
<p>We started a league at my work so I thought it would be good if we had our own league as well.  Metro are running it (it's free) so it's all online.</p>
<p>Once you have logged in and entered your team, click on the 'Leagues' link you can find on the left of the page.  Now enter the code 12861-3709 to join the private league.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
