  content: ! "Bugger, I am with f2s now after you had recommended em :( Generally
    seems good bit miffed that they wont let me pay them earlier.\n\nI signed up on
    like the 24th of some month. So forever I am getting screwed &pound;23.99
    on the 24th of every month.People like their bills paid in the first week of the
    month when they have been paid. I see no issue with them letting me pay one month
    on the 24th then moving the direct debit to the 3rd. But their support person
    acted like I was crazy. \n\nThey would get payment in advance of what they actually
    require so they would be winning ! Crazy bureaucrats"

  content: ! 'I think of ADSL as a digital line, over an analogue one, loads of little
    modems joined up = not so great. Fibreoptic is way better obviously, and I''m
    guessing that we''ll all have that eventually, or at least fibreoptic up to the
    end of your road, then normal wires to your house.


    I think LLU is ok, where I work we do it and it works fine, I don''t see why some
    providers mess it up so much, I''ve heard some really bad stories.


    Here''s my "up to 8 megabit" product results:

    F2S are still a decent ISP, it''s just that through LLU I was really with easyNET.  If
    there is a problem I tell f2s and they can''t do anything about it.  Then f2s
    send an email to easyNET and await a response.  It''s this crap model of support
    that infuriated me.

    I heard fiber optic doesn''t work well over long distances?'

  content: ! 'Oh, and just in case anyone cares.  I just watched Nacho Libre. It''s
    aweful movie with about 2 laughs through the entire movie.  Honestly it''s rubbish.  Failing
    having laughs usually puts a movie into the Drama category, and this is a piss
    poor drama if that''s what it is supposed to be!


    Never watch Nacho Libre, you''ll thank me for the  extra time in your life saved.'

  content: Yes. Nacho Libre is indeed "the shit" with emphasis on the "shit". The
    nun lassie is gorgeous though on the plus side.

<p>I have now finally managed to get my Internet connection back after being without net access all year.  I've gone with 10mb NTL, it's 2 hours in now and I'm happy.</p>
<p>Here's my parting words for my previous ADSL provider <a href="http://www.f2s.co.uk">f2s</a>:</p>
<p><i>I was under the impression I would receive 8MB down and 0.5MB up.  After using the service for 18 months I've found this to be 2MB down and 0.25UP (my neighbour however gets 6MB down on his ADSL).   For half the price I'm paying for this "8Mb" service I can get the same elsewhere for half the price.</p>
<p>The continuing outages also contributed to this decision after now having sporadic internet access for the last 4 weeks.  This is despite phoning your support phone line 3 times a week each week.</p>
<p>I appreciate all these issues are not the fault of f2s who have been helpful when I have asked for support, I've noticed the telephone support service has got better over this last year.  Though I never got a single response from any support emails I sent.</p>
<p>Today I've had NTL installed which is reporting at a happy 8.3MB down and exactly 0.5MB up (on the speedtest at adslguide.org.uk).</p>
<p>I'll still recommend f2s to anyone, but I'd never let a friend go with LLU ever again.</i></p>
<p>The irony is that when I put that into the "reason for leaving" textbox when canceling the service it refuses to accept the form if in contains an apostrophe in the text.  The defence rests.</p>
