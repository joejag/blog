    BTW, I was no where in the rankings before we started cross posting on each others

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>It's official I have content on my website now.  Arguably it's a load of pictures I took from various sources online but there's 30mb of them and they are all hilarious (my fave is the <a href="/pics/tyson.jpg">tyson</a> one).  You can access it through the pics link above or <a href="/pics">here</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="/pics/dontbombIraq.jpg" height="95%" width="95%"></div>
<p /></p></p>
