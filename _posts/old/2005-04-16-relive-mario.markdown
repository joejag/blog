<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I've been telling people about this guy for a while now and his movies are hard to find.  Luckily he's setup his own website now though at: <a href="http://www.videogamepianist.com/index_files/video.htm">http://www.videogamepianist.com</a>.</p>
<p>What is this you ask?  It's a guy playing video game music (famous for Mario Bros) on piano usually blindfolded at incredible speeds.  It's amazing!</p>
