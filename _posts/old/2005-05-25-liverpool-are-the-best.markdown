<p>As a football fan this is the peak of what you can ever wish for.  As a supporter of Liverpool since 1995 this is my happiest moment in football my entire life.</p>
<p>I will only listen to The Beatles for an entire month....it's going to be great.</p>
<p>Big thanks to all the great responses from my friends who support other clubs: Rangers, Everton, Man Utd, Arsenal, Motherwell and er... Montrose.  No thanks to the Chelsea.</p>
<p>Here's one trophy you fuckers can't buy.</p>
