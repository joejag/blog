<p>After being down for about 6 months I got my act together and fixed the <a href="/bacon">baconizer</a>.  So I'll enjoy showing people how I used to spend my time anyway!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, just put in 2 movie titles and it'll tell you the linking actors from both movies.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
<p>I never rememeber when my favourite tv shows come on air either.  So here's some direct links to episode numbers and release dates for them: <a href="http://www.tv.com/24/show/3866/episode_listings.html&season=5">24</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/desperate-housewives/show/24641/episode_listings.html&season=2">Desp</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/battlestar-galactica-2003/show/23557/episode_listings.html&season=2">BG</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/lost/show/24313/episode_listings.html&season=2">Lost</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/my-name-is-earl/show/31988/episode_listings.html">Earl</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/family-guy/show/348/episode_listings.html&season=4">FG</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/american-dad!/show/21935/episode_listings.html">AD</a>, <a href="http://www.tv.com/scrubs/show/3613/episode_listings.html&season=5">Scrubs</a>.<br />
