    not going to make it past the group stage) ;)

    with the fact that they are at the World Cup to care what happens!

  content: T&amp;T too excited? Have you seen the "national" television and press
    in recent weeks? Methinks the pressure on the England players might cause some
    nervous breakdowns before long! :o

  content: My holiday will now be 1 week long instead :(

<p>Having looked over my 27 (plus 5 days unused from last year) holiday allocation I've decided to use 10 of them to watch the group games of the world cup.  Some of the games kick off at 3pm so I would miss them otherwise.  After these 10 days the knock out stages begin with all games starting at 5pm and 9PM till the final which is at 8PM.</p>
<p>I'll be able to watch <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4686238.stm">every game of the world cup</a> now to keep up the tradition from my student days.</p>
<p>And if you were wondering I am going to France for a week (after the world cup) so I'm not using all my holidays this year for watching football alone!</p>
