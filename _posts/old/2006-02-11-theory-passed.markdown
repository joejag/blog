    \ \n\nQuit moaning about having to pay &pound;80 though.  At least you
    have a moderately well paid job to suplement it.  Try doing it on my wage.  But
    anyway... When's the real test?  I'm aiming for mid-march.  The gauntlet is thrown
    down again..."

<p>On my route to driving success I've now passed my theory test.  I got 34/35 (need 30+) for the theory and 56/75 (need 44+) for the Hazard perception.  </p>
<p>The test centre itself is like a library with hearing stations.  You get a touch screen VB looking app to play with at first then it's click the mouse button when you see a hazard after.</p>
<p>The question I got wrong on the theory (can't believe I got it wrong now) was: What causes you steering to feel heavy.  I put over inflated tires when it should be under inflated tires.  The rest of the questions were your normal obvious ones.</p>
<p>I'm burning &pound;80 a week in driving lessons at the moment ever since 15th January and apparently you need something around 50 hours of training before you try.  At &pound;20 an hour requiring 50 hours you can work out how much this is costing me!</p>
<p>In other news I'm off to a "rock for independence" shindig tonight so I'll need to get suitably plastered before attending.</p>
<p>Stay in school kids.</p>
