<p>In March 2007 I was approached by a fellow JP Morgan employee Kevin McDonagh about the prospect of working on a Google Maps application to promote sustainability in Glasgow.  Initially we were going to use the same codebase as the <a href="http://www.corkgreenmap.org/">Cork Greenmap</a>.  Their source was written in PHP, a language I haven't used properly since 2003.  Around this time Ruby on Rails was gathering a following and I read through the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Development-Rails-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/0977616630/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223218603&sr=8-1">Agile development with Rails book</a>.  It became pretty clear to me that this framework had a lot of promise.  Java frameworks certainly had/have a lot to learn from it's simplistic approach.</p>

<p>I decided to recreate the Cork Green Map engine entirely in RoR.  I managed to get a database driven map displaying editable markers in less than 200 lines of code.  Following this successful spike we settled on creating our Glasgow effort in Ruby.  Coding in a language like Ruby is a nice comprise (depending on your world view) as it combines the best aspects of both PHP and Java.  You get a structured, simple source tree that experts and beginners alike can master without too much hassle and get instant feedback on their changes.</p>
<p>Over the last year we've been very lucky with the caliber of volunteers joining.  We've had many great artists, web designers and coders dropping in and creating valuable additions to the Glasgow Green Map.  I've enjoyed leading the development effort (the web design element was mainly by others) and seeing the recent adoption of JQuery allowing us to perform excellent design effects.</p>
